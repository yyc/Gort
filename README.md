# GORT
Gort is a Telegram bot that was originally designed to provide useful functions to help declutter my everyday chats, but has quickly grown into a giant mess of not-so-useful functions.

##What Gort Can Do
- Tell a /joke
- Set up a /trigger to respond when someone says something specific
- Set up binds for a /command
- (Soon) Manage polls and responses
- Adjust his humor level

##What Gort Can't Do
- Provide real human interaction (it's in the roadmap)
- Marry you
- Spare you from being enslaved by the robot overlords when they take over the world


##Usage
Run `node/forever index.js <Bot API Key>` and pray
